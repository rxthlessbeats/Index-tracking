# Index-tracking
Using Least Squares Method and Quadratic Programming Method with different constraint to calculate optimal solution for index tracking

# What is index tracking?

Index tracking, also known as passive management, is a strategy used by investment funds that aims to generate returns similar to a specific market index. The fund will choose and manage its investments to mirror the holdings of the selected index. For instance, a fund tracking the S&P 500 index will hold the same 500 stocks in approximately the same proportions as they appear in that index.

# Why we choose index tracking?

- **Diversification:** Index funds are typically made up of a wide range of assets, which can provide investors with broad exposure to different segments of the market, thereby reducing risk.

- **Low costs:** Since index tracking involves simply replicating the holdings of an index, it doesn't require as much active management and thus has lower management fees than actively managed funds.

- **Performance:** It's difficult for active managers to consistently outperform the market over long periods. Therefore, simply tracking the market index tends to generate competitive returns over time.
